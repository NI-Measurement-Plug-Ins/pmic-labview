## InstrumentStudio Panel for Setup 1

### Usage

1. Select the appropriate source and load resource names and update other parameters as needed in Meas, PWM source and PWM capture configuration.

   Measurement Configuration:
     There are two mode for duty cycle one is constant duty cycle ran multiple time and other is sweeping duty cycle through boolean control DUTY CYCLE SINGLE PULSE/SWEEP PULSE
