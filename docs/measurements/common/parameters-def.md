# Parameters used in the measurements

## Measurement settings

1. DUT Setup Time:
   Specifies the setup time of a DUT, the time required to load the DUT parameters and for the DUT startup.

2. Source Delay:
   Specifies the time required for the source and load instruments to reach steady state after a setpoint change. This parameter can be minimized to reduce test time, but if it is too small the DUT will not have enough time to reach the steady state.

3. Aperture Time:
   Specifies the amount of time the source and load instruments collect samples and average the samples together to form a single measurement. Longer aperture time increases the test time but improves the noise rejection.

4. Nominal Output Voltage (V):
   Enter the expected nominal output voltage of the DUT. This value is used only for the calculation of load voltage deviation.
